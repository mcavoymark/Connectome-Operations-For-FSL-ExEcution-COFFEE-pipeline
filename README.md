# HCP-v3.27-minimal-processing-pipeline  

What began as the chicken scratch in daily-work/bash has evolved since Ben Philip in Occupational Therapy at Washington University expressed interest in putting together a processing pipeline for his data.  He needed it to work on Mac and it needed to be compatible with the FSL GUI for modeling and analysis.  

This is a work in progress. In the HCP/scripts directory are a number of bash programs that are modified versions of the HCP originals. Pardon the funny names. In essence, one installs the stock HCP v3.27 minimal processing pipeline
